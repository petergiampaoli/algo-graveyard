export const Text = `"So you're going to go through with it, then," Gandalf the Wizard said
slowly.
     "I am," Bilbo replied. "I've been planning this for a long time.
It'll give the Hobbits of the Shire something to talk about for the next
nine days - or ninety-nine, more likely. Anyway, at least I'll have my
little joke."
     "Who will laugh, I wonder?" Gandalf mused aloud, scratching his
beard idly.

     For weeks carts and caravans were coming from all over Middle-earth
to bring provisions for the Grand Old Party, as Bilbo referred to it.
Wagons of food from the Dwarvish mines at Erebor, shiny rocks from the
Sea-elves and fancy seductive packages from southern Mirkwood arrived
daily, making the neighborhood generally more crowded and cluttering up
avenues. Even those who hadn't said anything bad about Bilbo before were
starting to show their annoyance. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is starting to get a
mite annoying," old Gaffer Gamgee grumbled, standing outside the pub.
"Queer goings-on, and no mistake. Why just yesterday a bunch o' pesky
Wood-elves dragged their cart right acrost my yard and ruined my taters!"
     "A bunch of Men from Bree came to my place yesterday and tried to
sell me some aluminum siding," mused Old Noakes of Bywater. "They said it
was because they had extra after building that horrible Quonset hut over
the Party Tree, and they were trying to unload it. Strange folk
hereabouts."
     "Yes, but it's good for the economy," sneered Bill Ferny, the local
banker. "A lot more money in circulation. Market's been doing well.
Unionization is down because of all the entry-level service positions
that are being created. Widening gap between the haves and have-nots,
don't you think? Good to find work for idle hands."
     "And you don't know nothin' about anythin', Ferny," Gaffer Gamgee
snapped, echoing the popular community sentiment. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is a
right bastard, as I've often said, and it's small wonder if trouble don't
come of him and his imperialist ways. The Revolution's a'comin', and it's
the likes o'you who'll be the first ag'inst the wall, so sayeth the
Lord." And with that he spat a well-aimed beer-nut into Ferny's glass.

     At last the day of the Big Party arrived. Everywhere there was too
much to eat, and by midafternoon there were broken presents lying all
over the Shire attesting to the low quality of their manufacture. Gandalf
set off a series of fireworks later on in the day, including great
skywriting missiles and little flaming butterflies who took to wing,
sailed off into the Eastfarthing and burned all its trees to the ground.
     The last firework sent up a great black smoke which took the shape
of a giant mountain of fire. A flicker could be seen of a giant dragon
sailing about its peak; after a moment the great dragon went sailing over
the heads of the crowd, causing great panic and consternation and six
outright heart attacks before imploding somewhere over the
Sackville-Baggins' neighborhood, causing considerable property damage
which was never properly repaired for generations afterward.
     "That is the signal for supper!" Bilbo cried out to the survivors,
who were only partly mollified.
     Later on, in the specially-designed quonset hut which Bilbo had
built especially for the occasion, all his friends and neighbors were
helping themselves to their third helpings of macaroni and cheese and
potato salad (the latter laced liberally with what Bilbo called the
"traditional secret ingredient", which while not actually a narcotic
still had unusual effects, the sum of which were still under scientific
inquiry in some circles), Bilbo stood up and motioned for quiet. "A
speech! A speech!" some of his neighbors cried out in fear.
     My dear Hobbits! Bilbo began. There was much cheering at this,
as Hobbits on the whole are a rather egocentric lot, and anyway the
latest round of potato salad was beginning to kick in.
     My dear Bagginses and Bracegirdles, Boffins and Borfledebees,
Casmits and Cantankerums, Fassbinders and Fazoolas, Wombats and
Wafflefoots. "WaffleFEET!" cried out an irate old man at the back, in
fact the very man who had earned the name when Bilbo's nephew Frodo had
accidentally dropped a hot waffle-iron on his feet some years ago. He had
borne the Bagginses no ill-will, since the settlement was quite generous.
     Wafflefoots, continued Bilbo, oblivious. This is my nine hundreth
birthday! And though one million years is too short a time to have spent
with you all...
     There was some muffled conversation throughout the hall, which Bilbo
took notice of. Well, on bad days it seems like a million years, he
explained. Anyway, though ten billion years is long enough to endure
from all of you, this is IT... I am GOING... I am leaving NOW...
GoodBYE! And with that Bilbo leaped up, tore all his clothes off,
scattering them about the astonished guests' heads, and ran from the
great Hut screaming and flailing his arms.
     Young Frodo looked on in bemusement, refusing to answer questions
from the astonished crowd. Everyone knew, of course, that Bilbo was a big
man in the community. But - and Frodo looked at the crowd, particularly
noting the astonishment on old Lobelia's face - until now, nobody knew just
how big.

     "Well! That's done!" Bilbo laughed, emerging from the bedroom at Bag
End freshly dressed. "You know, Gandalf, I've been wanting to do that for
as long as I can remember. Now I think this would be an excellent time to
leave the Shire, at least before they can all find their torches and
axe-handles. Everything stays with Frodo, as we promised."
     "Including the Ring?" Gandalf asked.
     "Well, yes, I suppose so," Bilbo replied. He pulled the Ring out
from under his cloak, where it hung on a fine golden chain Bilbo had
stolen of old from the Brandybucks. "Still, though, I kind of hate to get
rid of it."
     "This seemed to me to be the only thing worthwhile about your whole
stupid plan," Gandalf said uncharacteristically. "Put it on the mantel
and walk away from it. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!"
     "It's mine! And I shall keep it, I say!"
     Gandalf raised himself up to his full height. Bilbo's hand reached
quietly for the hilt of his sword. "It will be my turn to get angry
soon," the wizard intoned. "Listen to me: you must give Frodo the Ring!"
     Bilbo suddenly laughed. "Oh, that?" he grinned. "Well, of course
I'm giving him the Ring! I thought you meant the chain." Slipping the
Ring off the chain he set the circle of gold on the mantel without a
second thought. Then he slipped the chain about his neck. "I love this
chain. Stole it from old Matuseck Brandybuck back before he went senile.
Wouldn't part with it for love nor money. No, I don't give two flies
about the Ring. Nothing but trouble, that thing has been.
     "Well, I'm off, Gandalf! I'm off on the road again, and not a moment
too soon by the look of that crowd down there." And taking an old
walking-stick from the stand by the door Bilbo went outside, taking a
path around the back of the Hill so he could leave unobserved, and as he
left he began singing a song quietly to himself:

      While often by the door I lie
      And look upon the mountains' feet
      And think of rains and hikers' pains
      And sleeping wetly in the sleet,

      When darkness' cry does terrify
      And wilderness encircles you,
      And being food for goblins' brood
      Is one choice, and starvation two;

      Then staying home instead of roam
      Will have a very great appeal!
      Forego the Quest! And have a rest!
      Let Dwarves and Elves and wizards squeal!

      But since the Shire is filled with ire,
      And all my neighbors fevers grip,
      It's plain to see! I must agree!
      The time has come to take a trip!

     Hours later Frodo returned to Bag End, a little glad to have thrown
off the pursuit at last. He started at first to discover someone waiting
for him in the living-room, but sighed with relief when he saw it was
only Gandalf.
     "Did he get away?" Frodo asked.
     "He did," Gandalf replied. "And just at the last, for they were
getting ready to set after him with dogs. Luckily he doubled back at the
Three-Farthing Stone, as I recommended, or there would be a special
bonfire in Tuckborough tonight. Are you well?"
     "Yes," Frodo replied. "I managed to convince everyone I was
uninvolved with the Hay Incident."
     "Good," Gandalf said. He lit his pipe with a nearby candle and
looked at Frodo evenly. "He left things for you on the mantel. The deed to
Bag End, a signed statement saying you were only an unwitting accomplice
in the Bywater Incident, and-"
     "The Ring!" Frodo said, looking at the mantel with astonishment.
"Has he left me that?"
     "He has," Gandalf replied, "though you'll have to find a new chain.
But if I may counsel you in the use of your own - don't use it! Now or
later! It may have other powers besides quick and easy seduction."
     "I can't believe Bilbo left me the Ring," Frodo gasped. "He used to
say that it and a bottle of Westfarthing Chinook was all you needed for
the perfect weekend."
     "Well, lock it up someplace and stay away from it," Gandalf intoned.
"No Took-wives, no Elf-virgins, and no real estate deals. And no political
aspirations! In the morning I'm off to see if I can learn more about it.
In the meantime leave it unused until I return."
     "I'll, uh, I'll think about that, all right," Frodo blurted, trying
hard not to think about the Ring and young Cassiopiea Took.
     The next morning Gandalf left, leaving Frodo with only his thoughts,
his yearnings and a half-empty bottle of Westfarthing Chinook for
company.
The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. Indeed, the
story of Banger Baggins, who used to run around naked at night and ravish
young maidens, became a favourite story, not least among those who could lay
a claim to belonging to that category. Frodo, however, remained wed to
celibacy. He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends,
especially among the younger hobbits. His closest friends were Pipsqueak
Took and Moribund ("Morrie" or "the Mobster") Brandybuck, one of them
friendly and willing if somewhat pimply, the other as cold as ice and as
ruthless as a society hostess. Not for nothing were Morrie and his family
feared throughout the Shire, even by the Shirriffs though those were all on
the Brandybuck paylist.
  Frodo enjoyed being his own master and the Mr Baggins of Bag End. He
lived on quietly, increasing his inherited fortune through wise investments
and high-interest loans which earned him the nickname of "Sharkey", until
his fiftieth birthday drew near. Then Gandalf turned up again. Frodo
welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard at
one another.
  "You are becoming grossly fat, Frodo," said Gandalf. "Luckily, I have some
really good exercise in store for you."
  "You are too kind," murmured Frodo. "Please don't exert yourself on my
behalf."
  "I'm afraid I have to," replied the wizard. "That ring of yours - do you
still have it?"
  "Yes, of course," said Frodo. "I would gladly get rid of it; every time
I've tried it on I kept stumbling over my own invisible feet since I could
not see them. I wish I had never accepted the pesky thing. Will you not take
the ring, Gandalf!"
  "No!" cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. "That ring would bugger up my
spells completely. No, no, I refuse! But I can give you some advice about
how to get rid of it, if you want."
  "What is that?" demanded Frodo.
  "Take it to Mordor and drop it in the Cracks of Doom," said Gandalf. "If
you don't, Sauron will come and take it. And you don't want him to do that;
he gets pissed off at people who have touched his precious ring." He lit a
cigar. "But if you put an end to the ring, you off Sauron too. The little
dimwit infused so much of himself in the ring that his destruction with it
is certain."
  "But I remember how you once told me that Sauron thought the ring had been
destroyed."
  "I did. He thought it had been thrown into the Cracks of Doom, as should
have happened. Now, however, he knows that it isn't so."
  "But how can he have thought any such thing? If the ring had been
destroyed he wouldn't have been around; so he should have realized that the
ring had not been destroyed."
  "As I told you, he is a dimwit. He really is incredibly stupid.All the
same, there was a scholarly article in The Minas Tirith Review about the
Ring yesterday, written by the learned Dr Faramir. Sauron must have read
that article; he subscribes to an excellent newscutting agency. His
emissaries may be on their way to the Shire at this very moment."
  "I had better leave at once," said Frodo.
  "I agree," said Gandalf. Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became
aware that all was very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one
side of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a
long arm out as if to catch somebody. Then his movement stopped. He
straightened up and snorted.
  "No one has been eavesdropping," he said. "Excellent. You'd better leave
as soon as possible, Frodo. Take that servant of yours, Sam, with you. He
looks like a sturdy lad and might come in useful."
Despite Frodo's resolution to leave at once, he was in truth very
reluctant to start, now that it had come to the point.  One afternoon
two or three weeks after Gandalf's warning (or maybe four, or perhaps
just one; Frodo spent most of the days that followed drunk, and rather
lost track of time), Frodo went to the wizard for advice.  "Gandalf,"
he asked, voice filled with concern, "I can't just vanish without a
trace.  After Bilbo's farewell stunt, I'd never be able to look the
old hobbit in the eye again if I didn't keep up the family tradition.
Like father, like son, you know."
  Gandalf, confused, said, "Father?  What are you talking about?
Bilbo was your first and second cousin, once removed either way... I
should know, I had to sit through two and a half hours of old Gaffer
Gamgee's genealogy lectures at the party.  Seating me next to him was
one of Bilbo's little jokes."
  "Oh, well, you know," Frodo fumbled, "Bilbo did have the Ring and
all, and my mother was quite comely when she was a lass... the whole
thing has been discussed before, though not generally in polite
company.  I'd rather not talk about it.  And anyway, this isn't
getting me any closer to an excuse to leave."
  "Don't worry, Frodo," replied Gandalf.  "I thought you might prove
to be hesitant, so I've taken some steps of my own to provide for a
suitably ignominious departure for you."
  Just as Frodo gave Gandalf a sharp, suspicious look, a hammering
sound came down the hall from the front door.  "What in the heavens is
that?" cried Frodo.
  "Unless I miss my guess," Gandalf explained, "those will be your
creditors.  I took the liberty of closing your bank accounts and
taking out a number of short term loans in your name from some of your
competitors in the 'Sharkey' business.  As I recall, they come due
today.  Incidentally, I've got to be off to, er, scout out the road
ahead, so I'll just slip out and catch up with you later.  Look for me
in Bree!"  And with that, the old wizard dashed off and was gone.
  Frodo leapt out of his chair in a panic, as the hammering on the
door became more insistent.  "What have you done with my money?" he
yelled in the direction Gandalf had run, but he knew that chasing the
wizard would only waste valuable escape time.  Fortunately, Pipsqueak
and Morrie were visiting for the day, accompanied by Pipsqueak's
annoying younger brother Fatty, and Sam was back in the cellar doing
some unspecified repairs.  Quickly, Frodo rounded up his friends and
explained the situation.
  "The Sackville-Baggins 'family' is here to take everything they can
get their grubby hands on," Frodo explained, "and that includes me and
all of my friends.  We'd better clear out in short order if we don't
want to end up at the bottom of Bywater Pool.  Quickly, now, run
through the hole and grab everything valuable that isn't bolted down:
the thought of the Sackville-Bagginses getting a hold of my things
makes me sick, and anyway, I'll be broke if we don't pile up some of
this loot before we go."
  Quickly the five hobbits scattered throughout the hole, filling old
pillow cases with whatever they could carry.  Frodo had a strong door,
but now the pounding gave way to a repeated ramming sound; he knew
they didn't have much time.  He met Pipsqueak, Morrie, and Fatty in
the study as they had agreed: it was on the lefthand side of the hall
(going in) like all the best rooms, for these were the only ones to
have windows large enough for a desperate hobbit to climb out in an
emergency.  After a tense minute's delay, Frodo shouted back into the
hole.  "Sam!" he called.  "Sam!  Time!"
  "Coming, sir!" came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam
himself, wiping his mouth.  "I was just saying farewell to Rosi--um,
the beer-barrel in the cellar."
  Frodo looked down at Sam's hand.  "Give me that Ring," he snapped,
as he yanked the ancient artifact off of Sam's finger.  With that,
they all scrambled out of the window along with their bags of loot.
Just at that moment, a great crash came from the hall as the door
finally gave way.
  "Sam," said Frodo once they were outside, "take this key to your
father, and tell him to hold on to it.  We're going need it when we
come back for revenge.  Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as
you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows.  We are not going
through the village tonight.  Too many ears pricking and eyes prying."
Sam ran off at full speed, while Frodo and the others loaded the cart
that Morrie had fortunately brought along that morning.
  The sun went down.  Sad and frightening sounds came from within Bag
End in the dark, as the Sackville-Bagginses wrecked and looted the
place in their search for Frodo.  Once the cart had been hastily
packed, Frodo sent Morrie and Fatty with it on ahead.  Morrie was,
as a rule, terrible company on a hike, and Fatty was a hundred times
worse.  "Sam and Pipsqueak and I will meet you at the safehouse in
Crickhollow the day after tomorrow," he said, and they drove away as
quietly yet quickly as they could.
  Frodo looked back at the dark black windows of Bag End, some of
which were being smashed out as he watched.  One of the windows near
the cellar seemed to have a ripped piece of a hobbit lass's dress torn
and fluttering on a nail. He waved his hand to his long home.
"Good-bye!" he said, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had
known it) hurried after Pipsqueak down the garden path.  Taking the
most secret route they knew, they jumped over the low place in the
hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the blessed
concealment of darkness like a cattle rustler into the grasses.

  They met Sam at the gate, and proceeded along the deserted lane for
a mile or two, at which point they cut off into the fields to throw
off pursuit.  After some time they crossed the Water, and made their
way toward the hilly country to the south.  "Well, I'll say this,"
remarked Frodo as he looked back into the valley of Hobbiton and back
to the Hill, where tiny flames had begun to rise from the vicinity of
Bag End, "that was quite an exit.  I wonder if I'll ever be able to
show my face in that valley again?"  Sam and Pipsqueak were walking on
ahead exchanging dirty stories, and Frodo's question went unanswered.
  The three friends walked on and on into the night.  Eventually, the
moon set, and after Pipsqueak nearly fell into a deep streambed for
the third time, the hobbits agreed that they should stop where they
were and sleep for the night.  Of course, none of them had thought to
take any bedding with them on the trip, so they all curled up on top
of the tree roots nearby, ignoring the soft, comfortable bed of
fir-needles that covered the ground beyond the roots.  They set no
watch: they had drawn lots, but when Frodo and Sam noticed Pipsqueak
cheating they all decided it was a lost cause and went to bed.
  A few creatures came and looked at them as they slept.  A fox
passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several
minutes and sniffed.  "Hobbits!" he thought.  "And sleeping out of
doors under a tree at that.  There's something mighty queer behind
this.  I'd better head off to tell my friends Bombadil, Gandalf, and
El Rond all about it in short order.  Good thing I can speak Westron."

  The next morning came, pale and clammy.  The three friends went on
walking through the trees, and Frodo began to chant to himself in a
low voice:

     The Road goes ever on and on,
     and on and on and on and on,
     and on and on the Road has gone,
     why did I let Morrie drive the cart?

Sam and Pipsqueak stopped and gave Frodo an odd look, but when he
didn't respond they all went on their way, deeper into the wood.
  The sun was beginning to get low and the hobbits had just passed
into a stand of beech trees when they heard hoofbeats on the road
behind them.  "Quick!" whispered Frodo, staring back the way they had
come.  "They must have found our tracks sooner than we thought.  Hide
behind the trees!"  He turned back around, and realized that his
friends hadn't needed his advice: they had already run a good ways
into the wood and buried themselves under a pile of leaves.  Frodo
himself only had time to duck behind a nearby statue of a Pukel-man
when a tall black horse came into view.
  On it sat a large black man, wearing a dark, dark grey cloak and
hood.  When the horse reached the statue level with Frodo it stopped,
and the black man started looking from side to side, breathing
heavily.  A light breeze blew in Frodo's direction, and Frodo caught a
whiff of a terrible smell like last Easter's missing egg.  He gagged,
and the black man stared toward his hiding place and began to climb
off of his horse.
  But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and
laughter.  The black man started to tap his foot, then hum along with
the music.  Finally, he started singing out loud, and then suddenly
realized what he was doing.  He got an extremely sheepish look on his
face, leapt up on his horse, and rode away in utter embarrassment.
  "Elves!" exclaimed Sam, coming with Pipsqueak to Frodo's side.
"Elves, sir!"  Frodo nodded, and as the voices drew nearer, their song
became clearer:

     O! What are we doing,
     And where are we going?
     We're soon barbecuing!
     The river is flowing!
       O! tra-la-la-lally
         up out of the valley!

     O! What are we seeking,
     And where are we making?
     The faggots are reeking!
     The bannocks are baking!
       O! tril-lil-lil-lolly
         the vally was jolly,
            ha! ha!

Well, okay, not that much clearer, but Elves are like that.
Nevertheless, Sam stood enchanted.  "Is it true, Mr. Frodo, that Elves
have drugs the like of which no mortal has ever known?  It certainly
sounds like it."
  Frodo answered, with awe but not without disappointment.  "Yes, Sam.
These are, indeed, High Elves.  Sadly, they share not their precious
drugs with outsiders.  Still, they can be good company, and they sure
throw a great barbecue."
  As the Elves drew near, Frodo stepped out into the path.  "Elen sila
lumenn' omentielvo!" he said in his most friendly tones.
  The Elves appeared confused.  "What do you mean, Frodo, that your
sister has a wombat through her tea-time?"  Frodo cursed under his
breath, and swore a silent oath to himself never to trust Bilbo's
language lessons again.  The Elf went on, "No matter.  You look weary
and hungry; would you like to come with us to dinner?"
  "Certainly, good people," replied Frodo greatfully, for the dinner
invitations of the High Elves are rare and prized indeed, "but how do
you know my name?"
  "We have watched you long," they laughed, "and your father Bilbo
before you."  At this, Frodo winced, but they took no notice. "Your
adventures with that young Cassiopiea Took were quite amusing, and as
for Bilbo, well..." Frodo was now blushing furiously, and the Elves
(together with Sam and Pipsqueak) simply laughed again and said no
more.  They passed on into the night, until they came to a clearing in
the wood.
  In the clearing, there stood a ring of great upright standing
stones, connected from top to top with other great stone slabs all
around the circle.  "Welcome to Sto-wan-hensh, our hall of feasts,"
said Gildor, the leader of the Elves.  "You are fortunate: it is
almost time for supper."
  Even as Gildor spoke, an Elf sighting along two tall stones cried
out, "The stars are now in place!  It's ten o'clock; soup's on!"
Torches and bonfires leapt into life all around the stone circle, and
soon the entire company was happily eating barbecued fox and toasted
cornbread.  A large flat stone in the center of the ring had been
scrubbed clean, and was surrounded by blazing fires that heated it
almost until it glowed; an Elf was frying bacon on its top.  The
hobbits tried not to feel disappointed when the High Elves didn't
offer them any miruvor when it was passed around, but other than
that the evening was perfect.
  Frodo soon decided to share some of his fears and concerns with
Gildor as they ate.  "Gildor, what would a black man be doing in the
Shire?  We were pursued by one today, and he only left when he heard
your company approach."
  "A black man?  In the Shire?" said Gildor doubtfully.  "I have never
heard of such a thing, not since the old days of the Kings and their
battles with Angmar.  Just about everyone in this part of the world is
Caucasian, and that's a fact."
  "And yet," explained Frodo, "he was there, and I was frightened.
I've never been comfortable around minorities."
  From the background, Pipsqueak spoke up, "Be sure to tell him about the
smelling!  I'm sure it is very important!"
  "Well," Frodo said to Gildor, "he did have this awful odor..."
  Gildor cut Frodo off sharply.  "Hold it right there.  This story is
racist enough as it is; we don't need any comments about 'Black
Breath' making it worse."
  "Right.  We'll drop the subject," said Frodo.  "Nevertheless, I am
pursued, even before I have left the Shire.  I am supposed to meet
Gandalf in Bree, but I don't know how I'll even make it that far, or
what to do if he isn't there.  I'm at a loss, I'm frightened, and I'm
bearing a terrible burden on which may rest the fate of all
Middle-earth.  Can you give me any advice?"
  "No.  Yes." said Gildor.`;
